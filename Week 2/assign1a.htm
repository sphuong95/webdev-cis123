        <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hi, I am a graduate from UC San Diego. I originally studied computer science at Orange Coast College and received a certificate in C++ Programming. After achieving the award, I transferred to UCSD as an undeclared major. It wasn't until after my first quarter that I deceided to study Cognitive Science and specialize in Human and Computer Interaction. I graduated from UCSD in June 2018 and have worked a few jobs and internships since, but now I am going back to school to learn more about Web Design because I aspire to become a UX/UI Designer.</p>
          <p>Aside from my educational background, I am invested in a 9man volleyball team called Fresh. I came across this team about 4 years ago, and have been with them since, learning more about myself and creating everlasting friends and family. I also enjoy many other hobbies: </p>
