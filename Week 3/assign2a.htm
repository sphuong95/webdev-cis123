        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Shaquile Phuong and I graduated from UCSD with a B.S. in Cognitive Science with emphasis on Human and Computer Interaction. I have been working a couple part time jobs/internships for the past year, and I am seeking more opportunities to learn new skills.</p>
		  
		<p>Before transferring to UCSD, I was pursuing career path as a Computer Engineer at Orange Coast College. I acquired a few skills in object-oriented programming and receiver a certification for "Specialization in C++", while learning architecture and AutoCAD on the side. After transferring to UCSD as an undeclared major, I found my path as a designer through Cognitive Science.</p>
		  
		<p>At UCSD I gained knowledge in design, re-design, front end web development, and team collaboration through my challenging courses. I established basic skills in HTML/CSS working on a mobile web application called "Mind Bud." I provided the basic navigational skeleton, implemented an "Add" function, and mocked up a calendar using tables.</p>
		  
		<p>After graduating UCSD, I set aside some time to learn more about web design on FreeCodeCamp, until I was hired to intern at EPC Power Corp. At that time, I was also working remotely at my other part time job as a Database Admin. From these opportunities, I learned more Python and Adobe Suite applications, including Photoshop and InDesign.</p>
		  
		<p>With that in mind, I am completing a series of courses this Fall semester at Orange Coast College to learn more web design skills and earn a certificate from the college.</p>
